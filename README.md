# Java Examples
Java examples and solutions of common problems.

## ReaderWriterProblem
Implementation of common computing problem in concurrency.  
Used `ReadWriteLock` - two related locks for writing and reading.

## ProducerConsumerProblemSimple
Another problem in concurrency. Threads are synchronised by `wait()` 
and `notifyAll()` functions - that's why I called this solution _simple_.

## Singleton
Implementation of Singleton design pattern.
Works correctly in concurrent environment.
